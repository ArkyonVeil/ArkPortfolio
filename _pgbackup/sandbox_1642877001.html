                <p class="d-flex" style="max-width: 404px;">Pixel Pets (Now known as Streamwalker Tribes) was the first project I worked on professionally over the course of a year.&nbsp; At the time a multiplayer gacha game with Action RPG elements.<br/><br/>Under contract as a &quot;Client-Side Senior Developer&quot;, I&apos;ve handled plenty of the UI of the game, programmed various front-end systems ,designed the home area, implemented various animations and occasionally worked on systems that interacted with the networking side.</p>

            <p>An attempt to mod Rimworld. A whole new faction had been made featuring various characters from the Madness Combat animation series. <br/><br/>Content included: New races, new gear, a new structure for crafting modded content, various new weapons as well as new player base raid events.<br/><br/>Plenty of sprites were taken and tweaked from the original .fla files, while others were brand new and built exclusively for the project.<br/><br/>The mod involved mostly XML based modding, but several .dll libraries was brought in to assist in implementing some more advanced functions not available in the game&apos;s API at the time.<br/>Unfortunately the project was cut short by an untimely hard drive failure.<br/></p>

            <h2 class="pt-5 text-center" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">Fluxworld</h2>
            <p>Initially an attempt to assemble a Minecraft Modpack, yet halfway through it turned into an art project to create the most surreally beautiful world generation that could be.<br/><br/>The end result was a stack of various layers of terrain lit on the top by the sky and glowing vegetation further below.
All the way down into a giant underground ocean over a cavernous hell layer.
While most of the looks were gained by carefully picked mods, there were several terrain alteration and &apos;ore&apos; placement algorithms that were retrofited for placing lights as well as various decorations.<br/><br/>A year later I&apos;ve programmed an actual JAVA mod that added a meteor shower event to the game.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-5 text-center" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">Synthrider AI</h2>
            <img src="images/synthridermod/Unity_IZr8l2XNxU.png" style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 36px;" class="imagoutline"/>
            <p>This private project was an attempt to extend Synth Rider&apos;s (A VR Rhythm game similar to Beat Saber) level editor by utilizing an AI to automatically generate said levels based on the song inserted.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The project was assembled in Unity and the AI framework was Fann, NAudio to import music and I managed to reverse engineer the classes used in Synth Rider into my own Editor as well as cracked the level encryption.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite my best efforts. Due to my lack of experience handling Neural Networks. The project was unsuccessful and the AI did not assemble levels that were fun to play.
Despite this, it was a great learning experience in handling data external to unity, reverse-engineering, multithreading as well as in introduction into coordinated AI training.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-5 text-center" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">Bots vs AI</h2>
            <div class="arkslotter">
                <p style="max-width: 400px;">Oh no! Earth is under attack! <i>Again!</i> This time it&apos;s a bunch of traditionally programmed bot enemies.<br/><br/>To fight them we have assembled some robots of our own that run on a neural intelligence. Bots vs AI go!<br/><br/>The project actually went surprisingly well, some of AIs ended up being so good at fighting that they learned to dodge enemy lasers, racked hundreds of confirmed kills and managed to blow up the enemy mothership after a few hours.<br/><br/>&nbsp;Each AI was on a per-ship basis and averaged at 500 nodes. Built in Unity and coded in C#.</p>
